IRINA
Hey Bee! What were you doing in the cellar girl? Up to something?

BLANCHE
Na, I got lost again on my way here. Weird how I was born here but can never seem to find my way around the house...

IRINA
Considering how huge is this place, I don’t blame you.

BLANCHE
Anyway, what are YOU up to with this big suitcase?

IRINA
Well, I’m going on a trip... With Walter. Over the weekend.

BLANCHE
Walter? The Golden Boy? No wonder Berleau agreed to let you go. She thinks she’s gonna hoard a ton of money.

BLANCHE
So… Are you guys a thing now ?..

IRINA
You wish.. I know you’re waiting for a knight in shining armor but Walter hired me for the weekend. There’s nothing between us.

BLANCHE
Yeeeeeaaaah, of course.

IRINA
Look, if you wanna be under my feet stop talking and start packing!

BLANCHE
It’s always weird when you’re not around… Plus who’s gonna save my helpless ass all the time?

IRINA
Haha, I won't be gone for long.

IRINA
Now give me a hand, will you?
