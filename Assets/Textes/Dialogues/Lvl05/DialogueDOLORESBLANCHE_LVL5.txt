DOLORES
So.. Have you tried to think that Irina might not come back ?

BLANCHE
Well even if I might have tried for a second..

BLANCHE
Now I can't. Mehdi just found something really weird.

BLANCHE
Irina's keycard. He checked it and it says she was on the balcony the last time she was here.

DOLORES
And ?

BLANCHE
And nothing. No entries after that. He found it in the concert hall.

BLANCHE
Someone must have dropped it here..

DOLORES
OR, Irina left the balcony with other girls and dropped it in the concert hall.

DOLORES
If she wasn't alone she wouldn't need to use her key..

DOLORES
Also, she would leave no traces behind.

BLANCHE
I know I just sound obsessed with my best friend...

BLANCHE
And I also don't want to prove me right.

BLANCHE
But you have to admit that I'm starting to have legit reasons to freak out..
