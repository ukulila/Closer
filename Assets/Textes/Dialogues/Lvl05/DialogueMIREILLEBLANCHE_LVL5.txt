Shit ! That dumb sign on the balcony isn't working AGAIN !

MIREILLE
The power's down in this area and the door to the balcony is closed..

MIREILLE
I'm not the house keeper ! Where's Mehdi when we need him !

BLANCHE
He left earlier. Had something to do for.. For a client.

BLANCHE
But I.. I forgot a bracelet there ! A gift from a client..

BLANCHE
I wanted to get it back today.

MIREILLE
If it's a gift, of course you should get it now !

MIREILLE
We don't want to upset anyone !

BLANCHE
What do I do now ? 

MIREILLE
Uhmm.. You could go check the power generator in the corridor near the Balcony ?

MIREILLE
It could work..

BLANCHE
I think I can do this..

MIREILLE
Ok but be careful.. The ladder to the sign is wobbly..

MIREILLE
That's why I didn't check before.

MIREILLE
Also it's not my job.
