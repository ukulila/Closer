MEHDI
Yeah Hi Blanche !

BLANCHE
It's BEE ! COME ON !

BLANCHE
Did you see Ray leave the building ?

MEHDI
Yes like 5 minutes ago..

MEHDI
But trust me he didn't go far away.. He was dead drunk..

BLANCHE
Ok. Ok.. Thanks ! I'll wait for him then !

MEHDI
Blan.. Bee ! I.. I have something to show you.

MEHDI
It's Irina's keycard.. I've found it next to the piano when I was..

MEHDI
When I sneaked in to see Dee's strip show rehearsal.

BLANCHE
Alright ! We'll talk about you being a creep later. Show me !

MEHDI
But I think it's broken.. I've checked the keycards entries on my computer.

MEHDI
It said the last place she went to was the balcony..

MEHDI
I know I told you we shouldn't jump on the conspiracy theories but appart from an alien abduction..

MEHDI
I don't know how she escaped the building.

BLANCHE
Thanks for the info..I'll see what I can do with it now. See you later !
