Hey Bee ! Any news of Irina ?

BLANCHE
No. Nothing... Nothing for the last 4 days..

MEHDI
Are you alright ? You seem quite pale..

BLANCHE
I couldn't sleep very well... I feel it. I can feel something's wrong.

BLANCHE
Something's WRONG about this place... And Irina's..

BLANCHE
She is..She is..

MEHDI
Woo. Calm down..

MEHDI
I'm sure she just need some time to think things through..

BLANCHE
You're just happy she didn't leave with Walter..You don't care where she is now.

MEHDI
Sorry ?

BLANCHE
Nothing.. I gotta go. I have to search all the rooms I haven't checked yet..

MEHDI
Wait ! I forgot what I wanted to tell you in the first place ! Berleau wants to see you in her office !
