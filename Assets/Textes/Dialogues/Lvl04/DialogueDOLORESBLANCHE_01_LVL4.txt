Bee if you're here to talk about Irina I really don't have much time.

DOLORES
And I've heard Berleau told you to stop asking questions..

BLANCHE
Actually, I came here because of Esdie.

DOLORES
Esdie ? What did she do again ?

BLANCHE
She said she knows something about Misses Berleau ? Something she wanted to tell ME personally.

BLANCHE
But she was too knocked out to talk to me. She wanted me to.. Sleep with her dealer.

DOLORES
OH GOSH !.. SHE SAID SHE WOULD TRY TO QUIT !

BLANCHE
I'm sure it's not that easy..

DOLORES
Anyway.. Let's try to wake her up.

BLANCHE
But how about her info ?

DOLORES
I think being shaken up would do her good.. Let me handle this.
