I was <clumsy>wondering</clumsy> if you heard about a rich foreign client..

MIREILLE
We had plenty last week.. With complicated names I can't remember !

BLANCHE
That's what <b><b>Dotty</b></b> said too..

MIREILLE
<b><b>Dotty</b></b> ? She wouldn't know !

MIREILLE
I gave her the day off when they came in because it was <b><b>Tom</b></b>'s birthday.

BLANCHE
Oh yes of course. <clumsy>She..</clumsy> 

BLANCHE
She said she heard about the funny and complicated names from the other girls !

MIREILLE
Well then, no one <clumsy>remembers</clumsy>.

MIREILLE
Happy ? Now go to Misses <b><b>Berleau</b></b>'s office !
