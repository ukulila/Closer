I was wondering if you heard about a rich foreign client..

MIREILLE
We had plenty last week.. With complicated names I can't remember !

BLANCHE
That's what Dotty said too..

MIREILLE
Dotty ? She wouldn't know !

MIREILLE
I gave her the day off when they came in because it was Tom's birthday.

BLANCHE
Oh yes of course. She.. 

BLANCHE
She said she heard about the funny and complicated names from the other girls !

MIREILLE
Well then, no one remembers.

MIREILLE
Happy ? Now go to Misses Berleau's office !
