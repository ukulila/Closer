BERLEAU
Miss Mercier. You are here already..

BLANCHE
Yes Misses Berleau. I heard you called me in?

BERLEAU
Yes I did. And I have heard you have bothered a lot of people with Irina...

BLANCHE
You know what I think about her disappearance and..

BERLEAU
Blanche you understand that I do not feed you and put a roof above your head because of your detective skills?

BLANCHE
Yes but all I want to know is if she's -

BERLEAU
Do you understand that you are currently disturbing the operation of the brothel?

BLANCHE
All I want is..

BERLEAU
You are not doing your friend any favour right now.

BERLEAU
She left her duties and I could have let this slide if she came back two days ago..

BERLEAU
But we have lost a lot of money because of this.

BERLEAU
Irina's our rising star. Or, was. I want you to take more clients..

BERLEAU
Fill the void she left in her regular client's heart.. You have what it takes, I'm sure.

BLANCHE
But I don't want to BE her! I just want her to come back..

BERLEAU
And she can. But as of today, she won't have a job anymore when she'll do so...

BLANCHE
But..

BERLEAU
..DISMISSED.
