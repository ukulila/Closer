BLANCHE
Ray I need some advice..

RAY
And I have some to give.

BLANCHE
I'm serious... It's about what you told me yesterday.

RAY
And when I told you to stay out of this, I was serious too..

RAY
Listen, I just don't want you to get hurt..

BLANCHE
And I appreciate it but I'm a grown up woman.

RAY
A grown up who mindlessly digs into a private investigation without any protection.. 

BLANCHE
Just tell me if you have anything on Walter.

BLANCHE
You told me that Rosie and the other girl HAD to marry those rich guys.

BLANCHE
Irina was just about to leave with one when she disappeared.

RAY
Bee, I have nothing on the guy...

RAY
You have no idea what you're doing AND you're obsessed with Irina.

RAY
I only see reasons for you to drop this.. And to seek help.

RAY
Trust me.. I know a lonely person when I see one. Go out ! Make some friends !

BLANCHE
Yeah.. I'll give it a try.
