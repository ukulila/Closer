Bee !Good that you're here !

MIREILLE
Have you got any news about Irina's whereabouts ?

MIREILLE
Clients are asking after her and there're only so many lies I can make up.

BLANCHE
I haven't heard from her since she left. But Dolores, Ray, Barney and Dotty..

BLANCHE
THEY have seen her the evening when she was supposed to be gone.

BLANCHE
Clearly I don't her so well.. You should maybe ask them.

MIREILLE
Wait a second i've got a call.

MIREILLE
Shit ! Not again. Yes i'm coming just throw some water at her face. Don't let her fall asleep !!

BLANCHE
What ? What is happening ? Did something happened to Irina ??

MIREILLE
No, No, it's Esdie ! She fell unconscious. AGAIN.

MIREILLE
There're also only so many clients Maggie can take in Irina's place.

MIREILLE
The girl's a little old for that much attention..
