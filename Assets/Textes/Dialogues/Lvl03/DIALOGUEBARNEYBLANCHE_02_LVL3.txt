BLANCHE
Can I ask you something Barney ?

BLANCHE
I just talked with Nikki and she was really disturbed.

BLANCHE
She says she can hear the voices of girls who left the house.

BARNEY
OH MY.. She's not taking her meds right ?

BLANCHE
Probably not.. But anyway, I wanted to ask you if you knew what became of Rosie, Jee and/or Kim ?

BLANCHE
I figured if anyone knew it would be you. Could really calm her down to hear some good news.

BARNEY
Actually I received a letter from Rosie's husband last month. She passed away from a lung infection...

BARNEY
It's probably something she caught after leaving the house but I thought you girls might worry so..

BLANCHE
I'm sorry to hear that.. But you were right to keep this a secret.

BLANCHE
What about the others ?

BARNEY
Sorry I.. I have to prepare a lot of cocktails for upcoming guests. Can we talk about this later ?
