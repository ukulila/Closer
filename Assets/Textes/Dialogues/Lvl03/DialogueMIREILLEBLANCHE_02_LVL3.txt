I think we should report Irina. You know she wouldn't run away like this..

MIREILLE
What I KNOW is that she would have made an excellent under-tenant..

MIREILLE
Clearly we didn't know her as well as we thought..

Maggie's the only reason I didn't report her earlier. You're sure you want to do this ?

MIREILLE
It's not just that she won't be under-tenant, she might lose her job.

BLANCHE
Irina is the most caring and responsible girl I know..

BLANCHE
She wouldn't leave her post for nothing. She knows how hard it is for the other girls when we're short staffed.

BLANCHE
Something must have happened to her.

MIREILLE
I think it's weird too but I wouldn't worry too much. She's very popular here.

MIREILLE
Maybe she just needed a break from all of this.

Since you agree, I'll go talk to misses Berleau.
