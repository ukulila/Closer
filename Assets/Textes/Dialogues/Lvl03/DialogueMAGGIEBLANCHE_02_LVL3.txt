BLANCHE
You're acting really strange these days.. What's so funny about me thanking you ?

MAGGIE
Because of ME that wrench will stay ?

MAGGIE
Just to be clear. I'm not being "helpful" right now..

MAGGIE
I'm taking back what's always been mine !

MAGGIE
Since day one that Bitch tried to steal my clients !

BLANCHE
That Bitch ?.. Are you talking about -

MAGGIE
Yeah the deserter ! IRINA.

BLANCHE
You think she did WHAT ? YOU GIRLS ARE INSANE !

BLANCHE
IRINA'S BEAUTIFUL AND SO WHAT ?!.. We all lost some clients when she arrived.

BLANCHE
Doesn't mean I hate her for that..

BLANCHE
You're getting older Karma. Deal with it. You cannot handle 5 guys at once anymore.

MAGGIE
You don't KNOW what it's like to be me in here. Cut me some slack will you !

MAGGIE
And you're underestimating me ! I KNOW what i'm capable of.

MAGGIE
I'm GLAD this know-it-all bitch is gone and I wish she wouldn't come back.

MAGGIE
Now get the fuck out of my sight before I call security over a cry-baby.
