Nikki's heard about Kim's whereabouts..

RAY
WHAT ? WHAT DID SHE TOLD YOU BEE ?!

BLANCHE
Wooo.. Take it easy. Just that you're a lying old man.

BLANCHE
And that you know more than you told me earlier.

RAY
I'm investigating little Bee. I'm undercover here. These girls.. 

RAY
They didn't just got married because they were pretty.

RAY
They are indeed with some rich men in a beautiful mansion somewhere.

RAY
But probably not really because they want to be here.

RAY
I don't really know much.. They won't talk to me. They're afraid of something.

My Advice : STAY. OUT. OF. THIS.
