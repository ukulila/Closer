Barney.. Don't try to hide things from me.

BLANCHE
First you're a really bad liar and second I really don't need to be protected as much as people think..

BARNEY
Well.. It's a kind of taboo topic..

BARNEY
I know Nikki's mentally unstable.. But I think she might not be totally wrong to worry.

BLANCHE
Ok Barney you cannot JUST tell me this.

BARNEY
I was asked to "shut up or else i'll never be able to speak again"..

BARNEY
I doubt he would hurt me but I also don't want to test him..

BLANCHE
Alright this sounds a lot like someone I know.. Should I ask Ray about this ?

BARNEY
Bee please for once, could you keep your tongue in your mouth ?

BLANCHE
Yes..?

BARNEY
Alright.. I know you won't. Just tell him you know about Kim's whereabouts.

BARNEY
Don't say anything about me and let his fear do the work.
