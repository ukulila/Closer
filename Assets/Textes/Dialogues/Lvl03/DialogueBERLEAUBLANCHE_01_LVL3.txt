BERLEAU
Well Well.. Who is bothering me first thing in the morning today : Miss Blanche Mercier.

BLANCHE
Good Morning Misses Berleau. I.. I didn't mean to interrupt.

BERLEAU
What do you want. Please go straight to the point.

BERLEAU
I have to finish this paper work and head to my hairdresser's appointment.

BLANCHE
I wanted to report someone missing.

BERLEAU
Oh no..  Not Again !.. Who ?

BERLEAU
What is happening to my precious girl that they all run away...

BLANCHE
It's.. Irina. And i'm sure she didn't run away.

BERLEAU
Oh you're sure ? Do you have any.. Proof ?

BLANCHE
Proof ? I know that several people saw her enter the building the night she was supposed to leave with Walter.

BLANCHE
I'm sure she never left !

BERLEAU
I understand your concern miss Mercier. I'll adress them later ! I should get going i'm late..

BERLEAU
Can you take these pills the doctors prescribed to Nikki to her ? THANKS !
