Hey Nikki ! Needed some fresh air too ?

NIKKI
I..I can hear their voices.. It’s like, they never left.

NIKKI
They don’t try to talk to me when am outside..

BLANCHE
Who’s bothering you ? Did a group of client made fun of you again ?!

BLANCHE
I could ask Dolores to end this you know. It’s our home we shouldn’t have to hide !

NIKKI

NIKKI
Rosie, Jee, Kim.. There’re sad and angry and they feel lonely. They need ME !
