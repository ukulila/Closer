Oh Barney ! You look unwell.. What is going on ?

BARNEY
I'm fine but a little shaken up ...

BARNEY
I witnessed something disturbing this morning.

BARNEY
Maggie.. I mean Karma... She was here drinking with a bunch of young lads. She looked really tired.

BARNEY
When she saw me looking at her worried, she put on this fake smile and started making out with them.

BLANCHE
I'm.. I'm sorry you had to see this.

BARNEY
I was more shocked by the fact that she would want me to believe she was enjoying this..

BARNEY
Than by the sight of an orgie.. Could you try to talk to her ? See if she's ok ?

BARNEY
I would probably normally ask Irina to do things like this but..

BLANCHE
I'll do it. Don't worry.
