Now what could possibly be this important that..

DOLORES
..It's <b>Irina</b>. She was still there yesterday evening but I never saw her leave her room.

BLANCHE
You must have mistaken, <b>Irina</b> left with <b>Walter</b> yesterday and I was there.

DOLORES
Well I don’t know what happened.

DOLORES
But I saw them outside while I was waiting for a client.

DOLORES
And they seemed to have had an argument and she went back inside ... through the backdoor.

DOLORES
I don’t know why but she clearly didn’t want us to know she didn’t leave.

DOLORES
Now follow me before someone sees us suspiciously alone in the <b>basement</b>.
