BLANCHE
I still don't understand. 

BLANCHE
If what you say is true .. Why didn’t she come to me? I mean ...

DOLORES
We’re not in pre-school, this isn’t about friendship or whatever.

DOLORES
One thing's sure, she's never left.

BLANCHE
But why ? ... I'm gonna find her.

DOLORES
As you want.

BLANCHE
Oh ... I almost forgot ...

DOLORES
My <b>whip</b> ?! It's on the bed. 

DOLORES
Now take it and get lost.

DOLORES
But… Do tell me if you learn something new about <b>Irina</b>, ok?
