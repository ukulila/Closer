I still have to process what you just said. If this is true at all.. Why didn’t she come to me? I mean…

DOLORES
We’re not in pre-school, this isn’t about friendship or whatever, I’m telling you she never left.

BLANCHE
Well maybe this isn’t about our friendship, but I’M gonna find her because I know her best.

DOLORES
Clearly she never hid something from you… Here’s my whip. Now get lost. But… Do tell me if you learn something new ok?
