MEHDI
Hey Blanche !

BLANCHE
it’s… It’s Baby Bee down here. You know you’re not allowed to call us by our names when we’re..

MEHDI
Oh. Yes of course Bee. Sorry. Are you here to take Misses Irina’s coat ? Mister Grey left it for her.

BLANCHE
Uhm yes, that is what I’m doing.

MEHDI
*whispering* I guess no bitches in her right mind would choose me over him…

BLANCHE
beg your pardon Mehdi ?

MEHDI
Nothing, just… Take it with you and tell her to be careful ok ?

BLANCHE
Why should she.. And why would you, the security guard, have her coat ? Are you two… No way.
