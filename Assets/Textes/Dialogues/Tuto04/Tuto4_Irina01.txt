IRINA
Oh great, thanks again. I’m just going for a walk.

BLANCHE
So you’re going out on a love trip with M.Grey himself… And you didn’t thought this was worth mentioning to your best friend ?

IRINA
I.. I’m leaving because I must do what is right for the ones I love...

IRINA
...But i’m not going on a love trip.

BLANCHE
What does this even mean…

IRINA
I cannot tell you everything but just know that I care for you, for you all of course.

IRINA
You know I love you Blanche.

BLANCHE
I know, I do too. Just, Mehdi said to be careful.

IRINA
I will. You will wait for me right ?

BLANCHE
If you look for me, I’ll just be here waiting.
