BLANCHE
I was just waiting for a client downstairs and Mehdi saw me so he gave me your suitcase. 

BLANCHE
So, there you go.

IRINA
Oh thank god Bee ! You’re saving me from a long conversation I didn’t want to have.

BLANCHE
Well, you missed quite a conversation. He sure has strong feelings about you and your little love trip with Walter...

IRINA
Jeez, we talked about this! Over and over. There’s nothing between us.

BLANCHE
Well, maybe you should tell him then. Over and over again. Because he sure thinks otherwise.

IRINA
That’s none of his business. And he wouldn’t listen anyway...

BLANCHE
Right. You should just avoid him for a while.

IRINA
Good plan.

IRINA
Okay… I should get going now... I’ll miss your dumb face.

BLANCHE
I love you too. Just... I know that Mehdi is a little too much but he told me that you “should be careful”. So.. Be Careful, okay? 

IRINA
ha ha ha ! I will. See you on Monday Bee.

BLANCHE
I’ll just be right here.
