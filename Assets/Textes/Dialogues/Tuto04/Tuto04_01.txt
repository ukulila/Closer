Hey Blanche !



BLANCHE

it’s… It’s Baby Bee down here. You know you’re not allowed to call us by our names when we’re..



MEHDI

Oh. Yes of course Bee. Sorry. 

MEHDI
Are you here to take Misses Irina’s suitcase ? Mister Walter left it for her.



BLANCHE

Uhm yes, that is what I’m doing.
 


MEHDI

*whispering* I guess no bitches in her right mind would choose me over him… 



BLANCHE

Excuse you ?!



MEHDI

Nothing, just… Take it with you and tell her to be careful ok ?



BLANCHE

I don't think she really needs to be. She's probably safer outside with the goldenboy than in here.

MEHDI
I wouldn't be so sure..

BLANCHE
I'll tell her. Ok ? Just give me the suitcase.

MEHDI
Here.

BLANCHE
Thanks.
